This repository is a quickstart to setup Mage ai orchestrator plus Elastic Search (this last one to create a vector db) all in a multi-container portable environment. This working environment is used to experiment with the content of [Module 5 - orchestration of LLM-zoomcamp 2024 cohort](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp).

In particular, a beta feature named RAG pipeline from Mage AI is used, offered to the learners of the course.

The RAG pipeline is made of two components: Data preparation and Inference

only the first component is experimented in the course.
